## Code Structure

The component is implemented as a React functional component using TypeScript. It follows modern React patterns including:
- Functional components with hooks
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Framer Motion for animations (where applicable)


## Animation Details

This component includes animations powered by Framer Motion. The animations are designed to:
- Provide smooth, natural-feeling transitions
- Enhance user experience without being distracting
- Maintain 60fps performance
- Support reduced motion preferences

Animation timing and easing can typically be customized through props or CSS variables.


## Best Practices

1. **Styling**: The component uses Tailwind CSS for styling. Customize colors, spacing, and other design tokens through Tailwind classes or CSS variables.

2. **Theming**: Supports dark/light mode through CSS variables defined in your theme configuration. Ensure your globals.css includes the necessary CSS variables.

3. **Accessibility**:
   - Ensure proper ARIA labels are maintained when customizing
   - Test keyboard navigation
   - Verify screen reader compatibility
   - Support reduced motion preferences

4. **Performance**:
   - The component is optimized for performance
   - Consider lazy loading if used in large lists or below-the-fold content
   - Use React.memo if the component is re-rendered frequently

5. **Customization**:
   - Props allow for customization without modifying source code
   - Tailwind classes can be extended or overridden
   - Animation parameters can be adjusted through props
